Hot Wheels: Extreme Racing is a racing game for the PlayStation, released in 2001. It features vehicles based on the Hot Wheels series I was curious about what the least played PlayStation games were and I figured I'd get a good enough idea by using the widely-used website GameFAQs, which lists PlayStation games along with votes submitted by users for rating purposes. I'm only listing games sold at retail in North America and I'm not listing demo disc games. I thought that listing games with less than 50 votes would be appropriate enough. For comparison, here are the 10 games with the most votes: Final Fantasy VII - 12534.
