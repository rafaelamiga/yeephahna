                            <p> Greg. What is your favorite segment from this movie? Mine was Bad Seed, the killer pumpkin. Any suggestions saw this last year and loved it. I already have seen Holidays and Trick r Treat. 
Been watching all the cheap Halloween movies or shows and came across Tales of Halloween. If you like gory, fucked up Halloween stories then check it out, it's pretty This is hot garbage. Of the 10 short films, 3 are enjoyable, a childhood revenge plot against bullies featuring the demon of All Hallows’ Eve, the final which is a short about a pumpkin that hungers for flesh, and the opener which is about the “Sweet Tooth” the ghost of a child who wasn’t allowed to eat his Halloween candy. The film had one decent scare that made no sense in the plot of its short and was in one of the worst shorts in the film. Don’t waste your time with this. It isn’t Avengers: Infinity War Black Panther Thor Ragnarok Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 Deadpool Spider Man: Homecoming Star Wars: The Force Awakens Star Wars: The Last Jedi Star Wars: Rogue One Wonder Woman Big Hero 6 John Wick John Wick: Chapter 2 Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice The Peanuts Movie Kubo and the Two Strings The Lego Batman Movie The Lego Movie Ghostbusters: Answer the Call Godzilla (2016) 10 Cloverfield Lane Jurassic. https://imdb.to/2JcoaUj (https://imdb.to/2JcoaUj). 
So we all know how they are ignoring everything that happened in Halloween 2-8. They are treating it as “stories people made up”. Basically everything after part one are stories made up about Michael Myers. Which is cool because it works in the way a “legend” usually works. It starts off realistic and grounded and then slowly gets more and more ridiculous. I would like to imagine that they reaction to people hearing the ever changing legend of Michael Myers went something like this. I love the classic movies in the background, the decorations, the lore, and just the quintessential Halloween-ness of it. Which is your favorite short. This won't be a full review, but Tales of Halloween is a ten story anthology film. Of the ten stories, I only found two of them (one about a revenge Demon and the other about a disfigured ghost who blinds her victim) to be worth watching. The other eight were either unforgettable or simply horrid (horrid in a bad way). I simply don't understand how any professional critic gave this movie a positive review. It wasn't scary (except for one shock scare in one of the two decent stories) Information --- Wiki Page ( Duration: 10/30 (Sun) 08:00 - 10/31 (Mon) 07:59 PST 5 Hero Stones for 1 Roll (1st roll guarantees a 4-star unit or higher) 50 Hero Stones for 10 Rolls (Guaranteed at least one 4-star+ units, and a "bunch of items") Bunch of items will be one of the following: 2x Stamina Gel L, 10x Peach Pie, or 10x Napple Candy --- Units --- New: (Charming Gaze) Kongwai (http://tales-of-link.wik. 
Has anyone else watched this? I think it was pretty solid throughout. Hey Reddit, it's Mike Mendez one of the directors and producers of "Tales of Halloween" which opens in theaters amp vod on Friday! So I'm happy to talk about that or my spider movies, or my upcoming film "The Last Heist" with Henry Rollins. So go ahead, ask me anything. You can pre-order Tales of Halloween on the official movie site here (http://talesofhalloweenmovie.com/). This is driving me nuts and I am really not counting on anyone to have the answer, but in the Tales of Halloween “The Weak and the Wicked” segment there is a metal song (sort of metalcore/mathcore) that plays as the bullies chase the kid in the ski mask on their bikes. (Movie is on Netflix and music starts at 34:43.) It sounds like a mix of Norma Jean and the Dillinger Escape Plan but I can’t fucking place it for the life of me. (Drums are kind of Dillinger but a little sloppy, guitar Hi! I'm Axelle Carolyn, creator of anthology film Tales of Halloween and director of one of its segments, Grim Grinning Ghost. The movie comes out this Friday! Got any questions? Fire away! You can pre-order Tales of Halloween on the official movie site here (http://talesofhalloweenmovie.com/). Hey, /r/metalcore. I'm reaching out to you to help me identify some music briefly featured in the horror anthology movie Tales of Halloween. It has elements that sound like both Norma Jean and The Dillinger Escape plan to me, but I can't place it at all, it's not listed on the soundtrack or credits, and Google is failing me. Maybe it's a song you just happen to recognize? Maybe you're a horror fan as well, or just like solving a mystery? Link to the post is below with a timestamped YouTube. 
This film has been on my must watch list since its release, after finally getting to watch it, it's pretty much what I expected it to be. There are 10 shorts in this "anthology" and I use that word lightly because the elements connecting everything is pretty thin. It's basically the same kids appearing sparsely in certain stories, kind of like Sam but not nearly as endearing. Like most anthologies, some are hits, some are misses, but most of the shorts were at least fun for their short stay. I'd rather have a blu ray than stream, because my streaming isn't good enough for my large TV, but the Amazon price is 20 bucks. I do enjoy horror anthologies, though, but I'm pretty picky. I didn't think Trick R' Treat was nearly as good as the reviewers. Limited Theatrical and VOD release Official Trailer (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2tA1e8UAZ4) Synopsis: Ten stories are woven together by their shared theme of Halloween night in an American suburb, where ghouls, imps, aliens and axe murderers appear for one night only to terrorize unsuspecting residents. Directors: Neil Marshall Darren Lynn Bousman Axelle Carolyn Lucky McKee Andrew Kasch Paul Solet John Skipp Adam Gierasch Jace Anderson Mike Mendez. Tales of Halloween perfectly emulates a trick-or-treater's haul in their Halloween candy bag. There are a few pieces of chocolate and candy which you want to scarf down right away, more which you eat hesitantly when you run out of the better stuff, and some which you flat out throw into the trash. The quality of the assortment of shorts follows that general pattern. On the delicious side, I enjoyed the opening short (Sweet Tooth), because it presented a funny and entertaining Halloween legend. </p>
